renderizr
=========

Renderizr is a library for fully customizable 3-d renderinug in pure javascript. The goal of this project
is to allow for the flexibility of GLSL and OpenGL in Javascript. Ultimately, I'd love to use this as an educational tool to help
people learn shaders while still being able to rely on a user-friendly and widely taught language rather than GLSL.
